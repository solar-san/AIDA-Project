# AIDA-Project

> Final assignment for a university team project. We coded three different AI based players for a Scopone game.
> More information about Scopone at: https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scopone (available only in Italian).

- [Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)](https://github.com/solar-san/AIDA-Project/blob/f8389a3ef2d16c535fdc1d9ef2575ea4b2b9abdc/Modules%20and%20Notebooks/MCTS.ipynb).
  - __Optimal Decision Making__: Our MCTS algorithm combines Reinforcement Learning with tree search to make optimal decisions in card games, even in complex and uncertain environments.
  - __Adaptive Strategy__: It adapts and learns from gameplay experience, continually improving its card-playing strategy by simulating and evaluating potential future moves.
  - __Competitive Advantage__: With this MCTS-based approach, the player can gain a competitive edge in card games by leveraging AI-powered decision-making to outmaneuver its opponents.
